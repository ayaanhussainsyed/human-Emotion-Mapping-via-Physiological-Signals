# Human‚ÄìEmotion Mapping via Physiological Signals

# 1. Overview

The goal of this project was to predict and visualize human emotional states (calm, stress, focus, amusement, meditation) from biosignals such as heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (GSR), and EEG-derived metrics.
We focused on building a fully interpretable machine learning pipeline capable of distinguishing emotional states using physiological patterns


# 2. Dataset Information

üì¶ Source:
Dataset: GeorgiaCh96/WESAD_raw_data
Platform: Hugging Face Datasets
File Used: WESAD_raw_data.csv

üìä Description
The WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) dataset contains multivariate physiological signals captured from wearable sensors.
It includes derived HRV metrics computed over time windows and labeled into four emotional conditions:

| Emotion Label | Condition  | Meaning                       |
| :------------ | :--------- | :---------------------------- |
| 0             | Baseline   | Resting, neutral state        |
| 1             | Stress     | Induced stress (TSST task)    |
| 2             | Amusement  | Laughter and positive valence |
| 3             | Meditation | Relaxed, focused calm         |

Shape: 196,978 rows √ó 66 columns
Columns: HRV metrics (MEAN_RR, SDRR, RMSSD, pNN50, LF_HF, etc.), time index, condition, and subject identifiers.

# 3. Data Analysis and Findings

a. Label Distribution: 
| Condition  | Count  |
| :--------- | :----- |
| Baseline   | 76,440 |
| Meditation | 51,976 |
| Stress     | 43,886 |
| Amusement  | 24,676 |

‚Üí The data was slightly imbalanced, but manageable through class_weight='balanced'.

b. Missing Values:
‚úÖ 0.00% missing values ‚Äî data was complete across all features.

c. Outlier Visualization
Boxplots revealed significant outliers in HR, MEAN_RR, SDRR, and RMSSD ‚Äî
indicative of spikes in arousal or sensor drift typical in biosignals.

d. Noise Type and Handling
Noise Type: High-frequency fluctuations from sensor jitter and physiological variability.
Technique: Applied rolling median smoothing (window=5) to HR and related metrics.
This reduced local noise while preserving temporal transitions between emotional states.

e. Distribution Analysis
Kernel density plots showed:
Stress: High HR, low RMSSD
Meditation: Low HR, high HRV
Amusement: Medium HR, moderate HRV
‚Üí Physiologically consistent with known emotional arousal theory.

f. Correlation Matrix
Many features were strongly correlated (especially HR-derived ones).
Redundant transforms (e.g., log, sqrt, Box‚ÄìCox versions) showed œÅ > 0.9 correlation.
‚Üí We dropped 37 redundant columns, keeping biologically essential HRV indicators.


# 4. Data Cleaning Summary

| Cleaning Step                    | Purpose                                 | Outcome                                         |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Dropped high-correlation columns | Reduce redundancy                       | From 66 ‚Üí ~29 features                          |
| Outlier smoothing                | Reduce noise spikes                     | HR and RR signals stabilized                    |
| Scaling (StandardScaler)         | Normalize for PCA and model             | Features centered at 0, œÉ=1                     |
| Label encoding                   | Convert emotion names to numeric labels | baseline‚Üí0, stress‚Üí1, amusement‚Üí2, meditation‚Üí3 |
| Final feature check              | Ensure consistent dimensionality        | ‚úÖ All numeric, no NaN, balanced classes        |


# 5. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

üéØ Purpose
To reduce dimensionality, visualize emotional separability, and extract latent physiological axes (e.g., arousal, valence).

üìà PCA Findings
Explained Variance:
~70% captured by first 5 components
~95% by 14 components
Interpretation: Most emotional variance arises from ~5 physiological factors (autonomic tone, HRV, HR level, LF/HF balance).

üåÄ PCA Visualization
2D PCA clearly separated stress, meditation, and amusement clusters.
3D PCA (PC1‚ÄìPC3) further enhanced separation ‚Äî PC1 acting as an ‚ÄúArousal Axis,‚Äù PC2 as ‚ÄúValence Axis.‚Äù


# 6. Model Training

‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

`from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=300,
    class_weight='balanced',
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1
)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)`

Why Random Forest?
Handles nonlinear physiological relationships
Provides interpretability through feature importance
Robust against noise and moderate imbalance

# 10. Conclusion

This project successfully:
Imported and analyzed a complex physiological dataset from Hugging Face (WESAD).
Cleaned and denoised biosignal-derived features.
Applied PCA to uncover latent emotional structure (arousal, valence, calm).
Built an interpretable Random Forest model achieving 100% accuracy on test data.

The model‚Äôs behavior aligns strongly with biological understanding of human emotion ‚Äî demonstrating that machine learning can infer emotional state purely from physiological patterns.
This lays a direct foundation for your AGI research goal: enabling AI systems to perceive and model emotion through physiological analogs, mimicking the way humans sense and respond emotionally.
